\section{Figures/Captions}

Place figures and tables at the top or bottom of the appropriate
column or columns, on the same page as the relevant text
(see Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}). A figure or table may extend across both
columns to a maximum width of 17.78 cm (7 in.).

Captions should be Times New Roman 9-point bold.  They should be numbered (e.g.,
``Table~\ref{tab:table1}'' or ``Figure~\ref{fig:figure2}''), centered
and placed beneath the figure or table.  Please note that the words
``Figure'' and ``Table'' should be spelled out (e.g., ``Figure''
rather than ``Fig.'') wherever they occur.

Papers and notes may use color figures, which are included in the page
limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black and white in
the proceedings.  The paper may be accompanied by a short video figure
up to five minutes in length.  However, the paper should stand on its
own without the video figure, as the video may not be available to
everyone who reads the paper.
