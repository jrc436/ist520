\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we give an overview of the theory of Collective Intelligence as it relates to Human-Computer Interaction. To fully cover this theory, we examine three separate descriptions: as an information processing model, as a model for small group task performance, and as a model of tasks at scale. We additionally compare Collective Intelligence to related theories and give a survey of papers in the area.
