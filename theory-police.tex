\section{Accessibility}
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the following five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Add alternative text to all figures
	\item Mark table headings
	\item Add tags to the PDF
	\item Verify the default language
	\item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
\end{enumerate}
Unfortunately good tools do not yet exist to create tagged PDF files from Latex. LaTeX users will need to carry out all of the above steps in the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat, after the PDF has been generated.
