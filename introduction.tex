\section{Introduction}

This format is to be used for submissions that are
published in the conference proceedings.  We wish to give
this volume a consistent, high-quality appearance. We
therefore ask that authors follow some simple
guidelines. In essence, you should format your paper
exactly like this document. The easiest way to do this is
simply to download a template from the conference web
site, and replace the content with your own material.
