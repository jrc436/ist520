\section{Sections}

The heading of a section should be in Helvetica 9-point bold, all in
capitals. Use Arial if Helvetica is not available. Sections should
not be numbered.

\subsection{Subsections}

Headings of subsections should be in Helvetica 9-point bold with
initial letters capitalized.  For
sub-sections and sub-subsections, a word like \emph{the} or \emph{of}
is not capitalized unless it is the first word of the heading.)

\subsubsection{Sub-subsections}

Headings for sub-subsections should be in Helvetica 9-point italic
with initial letters capitalized.  Standard {\textbackslash}section,
{\textbackslash}subsection, and {\textbackslash}subsubsection commands
will work fine.
